# Infinite Canvas AI Omnigen

An enhanced infinite canvas image and video editor with comprehensive AI model integration. Built on top of [fal-ai-community/infinite-kanvas](https://github.com/fal-ai-community/infinite-kanvas), this project extends the original with multi-model AI capabilities, video processing features, and client-side API key management.

üåü **Live Demo**: [infinite-canvas-aiomnigen](https://infinite-canvas.aiomnigen.com) (deployed on Vercel)

## What's New & Enhanced

This project builds upon the excellent foundation of the original infinite-kanvas and adds:

### üéØ **Multi-Model AI Integration**
- Support for various fal.ai models including the powerful **Nano Banana** model
- Comprehensive image editing with multiple AI backends

### üîë **Client-Side API Management**
- API keys are used directly in the browser, eliminating the need for a backend proxy.
- Simplified setup with no server-side dependencies.
- API keys are stored in local storage, and it's recommended to use keys with restricted permissions for security.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: 
> - This project uses fal.ai SDK on the client side, and API keys are stored in local storage.
> - Make sure to use API keys in trusted environments only and apply the necessary permission restrictions.

## Features

### AI-Powered Model
- **Multiple AI models** from fal.ai platform
- **Text-to-image** generation
- **Image-to-image** transformations
- Support more AI video models

### Video Processing
- **Video frame extraction**
- **Video trimming**

### User Experience
- **In-app API key management** - no environment setup required
- **Modern UI** built with Tailwind CSS

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun
- A fal.ai API key (get one at fal.ai)

### Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SparkSylva/Infinite-Canvas-AI-Omnigen.git

cd Infinite-Canvas-AI-Omnigen

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

That's it! No environment variables or backend setup required.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and start creating!

### Configuration

1. Open the application in your browser
2. Open the settings panel
3. Enter your fal.ai API key directly in the UI
4. Start using AI models immediately

> üí° **API Key Usage**:
>
> * This application calls the fal.ai API directly from the client, with no server-side proxy required.
> * API keys are managed and used directly in the browser, simplifying the deployment process.
> * All AI requests are sent from the browser directly to fal.ai's servers.
> * This approach avoids complex backend setup but requires users to manage their API key security.
